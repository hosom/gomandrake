## Example Plugins

This section is dedicated for plugin examples. The plugins here are basic examples of how to get started. 

Generally speaking, plugins should consist of an *analyze* method for Mandrake to call and should be built to support async i/o. This can be especially difficult in Python, so the pymandrake module was created to make this easier. You can find the pymandrake module at its [source code repository on GitHub](https://github.com/hosom/pymandrake)
